The "generic" notes for putting this thing together are below.  Here's the 
short version.

1.) ./configure
2.) make
3.) cp ./socks5-1.0/etc/* /etc/socks5/
4.) Edit the socks5.conf with specific details for your system
5.) ./socks5-1.0/src/socks5
7.) Have fun!

Any questions? Please send takesi.itsec@gmail.com it.

================================================================================

note: You must create the ca certificate, ca key, leaf key and content log directory before run.
The path of content log directory is stored in the configuration file(/etc/socsk/socks5.conf).
If this don't run, please set the log level as 0 and show the log file.

Thanks.
